These projects are independent of each other, but are part of the requirements needed to pass the CS50 course from Harvard. 

## Degrees

### Overview
This project lets you see the connections between two Hollywood actors and actresses. For example, if I wanted to know the degrees of seperation between
Emma Watson and Tom Cruise, I would input: 


`Name: Emma Watson `

`Name: Tom Cruise`


The output would be:


`1: Emma Watson and Jennifer Connelly starred in Noah`

`2: Jennifer Connelly and Tom Cruise starred in Top Gun: Maverick`


The application would then ask me:


`Would you like to go again (enter yes or no): `


And then the process repeats

### Usage 
Download the source code and enter the **/degrees** directory. Run the following:

`python3 degrees.py [directory]`

where the directory is "large" or "small". By default, it is the large dataset.
